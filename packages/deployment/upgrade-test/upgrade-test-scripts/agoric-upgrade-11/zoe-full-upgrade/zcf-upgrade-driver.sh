# This shows how to upgrade Zoe and ZCF on a running chain. It presumes that
# The bundles for Zoe and ZCF have been installed, and their hashes updated in
# zcf-upgrade-script.js. The bundles can be generated by running the test in
# vats/test/bootstrapTests/test-zcf-upgrade.js, noting the logged ZOE BUNDLE ID
# and ZCF BUNDLE ID, and finding the corresponding bundles in ~/.agoric/cache.
#  !!   THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY   !!
