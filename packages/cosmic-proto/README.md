# Protobuf Stubs for Cosmic Swingset

This package exports JavaScript and TypeScript generated from Cosmic Swingset
Protobuf IDL so that clients can communicate with the Agoric chain.

Package exports are defined in `exports` and also made available in the
`swingset/` file path for backwards compatibility.
