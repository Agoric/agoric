# We avoid copying these into a docker build context, because we're
# also not copying the .git directories. If someone runs "docker
# build" from a non-clean agoric-sdk tree, the build context would
# have moddable/ source files but no moddable/.git, and that would be
# confused with an unpacked NPM tarball. See
# packages/xsnap/src/build.js for details.
# When changing/adding entries here, make sure to search the whole project for
# `@@AGORIC_DOCKER_SUBMODULES@@`
